    <l1>1 and 3/4 cups granulated sugar</l1>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons espresso powder</li>
    <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 large eggs(room temp)</li>
    <li>1 cup freshly brewed <strong>hot</strong> coffee</li>
</ul>
<h5>Chocolate Buttercream</h5>
<ul>
    <li>1 and 1/4 cups unsalted butter</li>
    <li>3 and 1.2 cups confectioners sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>3-5 Tablespoons heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>Optional for decoration: Semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the cake:</strong> Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder (if using) together in a large bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or you can use a whisk) mix the oil, eggs, and vanilla together on medium-high speed until combined. Add the buttermilk and mix until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the hot water/coffee, and whisk or beat on low speed until the batter is completely combined.</li>
    <li>Divide batter evenly between pans. Bake for 23-26 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the buttercream:</strong> With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy – about 2 minutes. Add confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder, 3 Tablespoons heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 full minute. Do not over-whip. Add 1/4 cup more confectioners’ sugar or cocoa powder if frosting is too thin or 1-2 more Tablespoons of cream if frosting is too thick.</li>
    <li><strong>Assemble and frost:</strong> If cooled cakes are domed on top, use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the tops to create a flat surface. This is called “leveling” the cakes. Discard or crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides.</li>
    <li>Garnish with chocolate chips if desired.</li>
